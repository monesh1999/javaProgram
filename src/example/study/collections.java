		 * 
		 * The Java Collection Framework is an architecture that provides a set of classes and interfaces 
		 * for storing and manipulating groups of objects. 
		 * It is part of java.util package and offers ready-to-use data structures like lists, sets, maps, and queues.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Features of Collection Framework:

            Reusable data structures

            Reduces programming effort (predefined algorithms)

            Increases performance (optimized classes)

            Type-safe with Generics (List<String> vs raw List)

            Thread-safe collections available (Collections.synchronizedList())
